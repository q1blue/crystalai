Visual elements are programmed in Adobe® ActionScript® 3.0 by working with display objects on the display stage. For example, you can add, move, remove, and order display objects, apply filters and masks, draw vector and bitmap graphics, and perform three-dimensional transformations using the ActionScript display programming API. The primary classes used for display programming are part of the `flash.display` package .
