## Contributing to airsdk.dev

Thank you for helping us make AIR great!  



### Submit a guide or tutorial 

Currently the AIR platform is in desparate need of a documentation refresh. Lots of the documentation has been removed from Adobe's site and it is unknown as to when the last reference materials will be removed. This site aims to become the developer documentation portal, providing the basis for a community driven documentation site.

All the tutorials and guides are written in standard markdown so if you have time to create something, please feel free and either send it to us or submit a pull request.

Currently what we need is contributions to the `docs` directory, including tutorials, guides and developer documentation. We have started pulling across some of the old AIR material but much of this needs updating and refreshing.
