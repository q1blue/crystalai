When an Android APK build is\\r\\nrequested, the default mechanism is now to use Gradle (similarly to how the AAB bundles are created). This\\r\\nbrings some parity to the two mechanisms which should help to ensure developers don\u2019t encounter problems\\r\\nwith deployed bundles that haven\u2019t been first spotted during local testing.\\r\\nFor developers who would prefer to keep using the earlier APK generation mechanisms, a flag can be added\\r\\nto the XML Descriptor File under the &lt;android&gt; section: \u201c&lt;BuildLegacyAPK&gt;true&lt;/BuildLegacyAPK&gt;\u201d.\\r\\n  \\r\\n### 3.1.5 Bug Fixes  \\r\\ngithub-972: Ensure signing of an App Bundle preserves the file permissions  \\r\\ngithub-1006: Adding support for \'webViewAllowFileAccess\' tag for Android local file access in WebView  \\r\\ngithub-1340: Ensuring \'resdir\' option in XML descriptor can use relative paths  \\r\\ngithub-1376: Ensuring no-compress settings are used in App Bundle packages  \\r\\ngithub-1391: Fixing signing block format for dynamic frameworks in macho binaries  \\r\\ngithub-1392: Android APK: updating Java code generation to target 1.8  \\r\\ngithub-1397: Ensuring Android package names don\'t include Java reserved words  \\r\\ngithub-apm40: Fixing crash when using command-line tools with nativeprocess  \\r\\nAIR-4740: Remove use of sun internal security classes for APK/AAB signing  \\r\\nAIR-5427: AIR Android security update for https certificate errors"},{"id":"/2021/10/14/new-additions","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021/10/14/new-additions","source":"@site/news/2021-10-14-new-additions.md","title":"Community and Showcase Sections","description":"Due to a lot of requests over the previous months we have added several new sections to promote developers and better direct people to the current resources available for AIR.","date":"2021-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"airsdk","permalink":"/news/tags/airsdk"},{"label":"updates","permalink":"/news/tags/updates"}],"readingTime":1.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Developer at distriqt","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Community and Showcase Sections","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["airsdk","updates"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 33.1.1.698","permalink":"/news/2021/12/02/new-air-release"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/news/welcome"}},"content":"Due to a lot of requests over the previous months we have added several new sections to promote developers and better direct people to the current resources available for AIR.\\n\\nWe also have started creating a detailed [\\"Getting Started\\"](/docs/basics/getting-started) guide to walk new users through the installation of the AIR SDK and setup of a development environment.\\n\\nThe first of these is the [Community](/community) section.
