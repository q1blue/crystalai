Just like when you use the drawing tools in Adobe\xae Flash\xae Professional or another drawing application, when you\u2019re using ActionScript to draw you can draw with or without a stroke, and with or without a fill color. You specify the appearance of the stroke using the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"lineStyle()")," or ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"lineGradientStyle()")," method. To create a solid line, use the ",(0,a.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"lineStyle()")," method. When calling this method, the most common values you\u2019ll specify are the first three parameters: line thickness, color, and alpha.
