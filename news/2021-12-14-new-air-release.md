## Changes and Issues
3.1 Changes in this Release  

### 3.1.1 Runtime  
No changes – the below details will be fixed for all “33.1” version numbers:  
Namespace: 33.1  
SWF version: 44  
  
The namespace and SWF version updates are made across all platforms and may be used to access the
updated ActionScript APIs that will be introduced in future beta releases of 33.1.
Note that using “33.0” as a namespace is not valid, and is resulting in behaviors such as VerifyErrors being
dispatched at application start-up with built-in class names such as ExtensionContext, Context3D, and others.
  
### 3.1.2 Build Tools  
Xcode 13 and the latest macOS and iphoneOS SDKs are now being used to build the AIR SDK.
The build system for this is on a version of macOS that doesn’t support 32-bit processes hence we cannot
generate the 32-bit versions of the stub files. This means that we can no longer support older 32-bit
iPhone/iPad devices.
  
### 3.1.3 AS3 APIs  
Updated AS3 APIs are described in section 12.
  
### 3.1.4 Features
